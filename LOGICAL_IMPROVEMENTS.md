# Logical Improvements to Leave Tracking System

## Overview
This document outlines the logical improvements made to the leave tracking system to enhance user experience and data integrity.

## 1. Allow Leave Requests for Previous Dates

### Before
- Users could only request leave for current or future dates
- Past date selection was blocked by form validation
- `min` attribute on date inputs restricted date selection

### After
- Users can now request leave for any date (past, present, or future)
- Form validation allows past dates
- Confirmation dialog warns users when selecting past dates
- Useful for:
  - Backdating leave requests
  - Correcting missed leave applications
  - Historical record keeping

### Implementation
- Removed date restriction from `isRequestValid()` function
- Removed `min` attribute from date inputs
- Added confirmation dialog for past dates

## 2. Prevent Duplicate Leave Requests

### Before
- No validation against duplicate leave requests
- Users could accidentally submit multiple requests for the same dates
- Database had no constraints to prevent duplicates

### After
- Application-level duplicate checking before submission
- Database-level constraints to prevent overlapping leaves
- Clear error messages when duplicates are detected

### Implementation

#### Application Level
- Added `checkDuplicateLeaveRequest()` function in `supabaseService.ts`
- Checks for overlapping date ranges with existing pending/approved requests
- Prevents submission if conflicts are detected

#### Database Level
- Created `prevent_duplicate_leaves.sql` script
- Added unique index on `(user_id, start_date, end_date, status)`
- Created trigger function to check for overlapping dates
- Enforces constraints at database level for data integrity

### Duplicate Detection Logic
A leave request is considered duplicate if:
- Same user has existing request
- Existing request is either 'pending' or 'approved'
- Date ranges overlap (start_date ≤ existing_end_date AND end_date ≥ existing_start_date)

## 3. Enhanced User Experience

### Information Display
- Added blue information box explaining leave request rules
- Clear messaging about duplicate prevention
- Guidance on checking existing requests

### Error Handling
- Specific error messages for duplicate requests
- Confirmation dialogs for unusual scenarios (past dates)
- Better validation feedback

### Form Validation
- Maintains existing balance checking
- Enhanced date validation
- User-friendly error messages

## 4. Database Schema Improvements

### New Constraints
```sql
-- Unique constraint to prevent duplicate requests
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_unique_user_dates 
ON leave_requests (user_id, start_date, end_date, status) 
WHERE status IN ('pending', 'approved');

-- Trigger function to check for overlapping dates
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION check_overlapping_leaves()
-- ... implementation details
```

### Benefits
- Data integrity at database level
- Prevents race condition issues
- Consistent constraint enforcement

## 5. Testing Scenarios

### Valid Cases
- ✅ Request leave for future dates
- ✅ Request leave for past dates (with confirmation)
- ✅ Request leave for current date
- ✅ Half-day leave requests
- ✅ Multi-day leave requests

### Invalid Cases
- ❌ Duplicate request for same dates
- ❌ Overlapping date ranges
- ❌ Insufficient leave balance
- ❌ Invalid date ranges (end before start)

## 6. Deployment Notes

### Database Changes
1. Run `scripts/prevent_duplicate_leaves.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor
2. Verify constraints are active
3. Test with sample data

### Application Changes
- No environment variable changes required
- Existing functionality preserved
- Enhanced validation and user experience

## 7. Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
- Real-time conflict checking as user types dates
- Calendar view showing existing leave requests
- Bulk leave request handling
- Leave request templates
- Manager approval workflow improvements

### Monitoring
- Track duplicate prevention effectiveness
- Monitor user feedback on past date allowance
- Performance metrics for validation functions

## Conclusion

These logical improvements significantly enhance the leave tracking system by:
1. **Increasing flexibility** - Users can now request leave for any date
2. **Improving data integrity** - Prevents duplicate and conflicting requests
3. **Enhancing user experience** - Better guidance and error messages
4. **Strengthening validation** - Both application and database level checks

The system now provides a more robust and user-friendly experience while maintaining data consistency and preventing common user errors.
